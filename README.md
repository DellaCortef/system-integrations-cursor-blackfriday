# Creating a data extraction flow.

## Systems used:

- Google Analytics;
- Typeform;
- eduzz.

We will use Python to perform three system integrations.

We will create a Data Warehouse consolidating our data so that, after transforming the data into information, we will make it available to our Business areas. This project can be used for different systems, as the concept would be the same.

## Google Analytics

Google Analytics provides stream information from any website that is integrated with it. With GA4, we can analyze and control user flow within our website.

This will be our first integrated tool within this repository.

## Typeform

The second tool that will be integrated is a typeform, in which some questions necessary to continue the service/product purchase flow will be answered. The forms have seven questions, and the objective of the analyzes at the end will be to understand which question specifically users give up on the purchase. We will analyze the sales funnel. Typeform consumption will be via API.
